## **Heart Disease Prediction | Machine Learning**  

In this project, we developed a **Machine Learning model** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.  

We used the **scikit-learn (sklearn)** library for data processing and applied **Logistic Regression** for model training. This classification algorithm helps in identifying patterns in medical data to assess heart disease risk.  

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Data Collection and Processing** – Preprocessed patient health data for accurate model training.  
✅ **Feature & Target Splitting** – Divided dataset into relevant features and target variables for supervised learning.  
✅ **Logistic Regression Model** – A widely used algorithm for binary classification in medical predictions.  
✅ **Train-Test Split** – Evaluated model performance by splitting data into training and testing sets.  
✅ **Python & Scikit-learn Implementation** – Leveraged standard ML libraries for efficient model building.  

This project showcases how machine learning can assist in medical diagnosis by predicting heart disease based on clinical data.
